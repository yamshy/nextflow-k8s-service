## Summary
Fixes the Nextflow configuration to properly set resource limits using `k8s.cpuLimits` and `k8s.memoryLimits` instead of invalid `pod` directive syntax.

## Why
v1.8.1 introduced a bug where the `pod` directive was used incorrectly:
```groovy
pod = [[resources: ...]]  # Invalid - "Unknown pod options: [resources:...]"
```

The `pod` directive doesn't accept a `resources` key. Instead, Nextflow provides `cpuLimits` and `memoryLimits` settings in the `k8s` scope.

## Implementation
```groovy
process {
    executor = 'k8s'
    cpus = 1          # Sets the CPU limit
    memory = '1Gi'    # Sets the memory limit
}

k8s {
    cpuLimits = '1'          # Enforces CPU limits on pods
    memoryLimits = '1Gi'     # Enforces memory limits on pods
}
```

This approach:
1. Sets process-level resource requirements
2. Enables limit enforcement via `cpuLimits` and `memoryLimits`
3. Satisfies ResourceQuota requirements

## Test Plan
- [x] All tests pass
- [ ] Deploy and verify workflows run successfully without "Unknown pod options" error
